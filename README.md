# PASS UI

PASS UI is the user interface component of the PASS application, developed using the Ember.js framework. It connects 
with PASS Core via an Elide-based API to display and manage data related to submissions, repositories, policies, and 
users. PASS UI streamlines the submission process, guiding users through creating, updating, and completing their 
submissions while ensuring compliance with funder and institutional policies. Its design emphasizes ease of use, 
enabling researchers to navigate the scholarly deposit process with minimal friction.

You can find further documentation and details about [PASS UI](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org/developer-documentation/pass-ui)
on the [full documentation site](https://docs.eclipse-pass.org). A full list of all the Eclipse PASS projects can also
be found in the PASS Main repository [README](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/blob/main/README.md).
